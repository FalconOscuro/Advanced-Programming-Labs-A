\section{Average}
    \subsection*{Question}
    Using a while loop (or do-while loop), calculate the average value of values provided by the user from the console (cin).
    You should calculate the average after the user either enters a negative number or the user enters a non-number value (e.g. a letter).
        
    \subsection*{Sample Output}
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{c c}
                \hline
                \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output} \\
                \hline
                20, 50, 60, 77, 79 & 57.2 \\
                \hline
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Data output}
        \end{table}

    \subsection*{Reflection}
        The length of the program was greatly shortened, as parsing can
        be entirely integrated into the conditional of the for loop.
        This does, however reduce the readability of the source code.
